To advance the **development** of digital public goods, we have created this curated list of product features coming from the technical roadmaps of [digital public goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry), for others to contribute their knowledge, time and expertise. The one key difference with a proper product backlog is that projects are listed chronologically, instead of being ordered by priority.

Product features listed in this backlog are scoped to require the work of a small- to medium-sized technical team over the course of one to three months, and thus require a commitment over that period. If you are an individual interested in more bite-sized contributions to these projects, we encourage you to visit their open issues in their code respositories or visit the [Open Source Center Hub](https://hub.osc.dial.community/c/osc/37) where you will find a myriad of opportunities.

## 🤝 Add Projects to the Backlog

A project is required to be a digital public good to be listed in this backlog. Refer to the [Digital Public Goods Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/) for the requirements of becoming a digital public good. Nominations of new digital public goods are accepted through the [submission form](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/submission).

To add new projects to the backlog, do the following:
1. Add a new file under the `_posts/` folder using the following template, replacing all `{values inside brackets}`. The file uses [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Name the file as follows: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`, where `YYYY-MM-DD` refers to the day you add this file:

```
