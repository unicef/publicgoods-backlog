The [Digital Public Goods Alliance](https://digitalpublicgoods.net) works to advance the discovery, **development** and deployment of digital public goods, defined as *open source software, open data, open AI models, open standards and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, and help attain the Sustainable Development Goals*.

To advance the **development** of digital public goods, we have created this curated list of product features coming from the technical roadmaps of [digital public goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry), for others to contribute their knowledge, time and expertise. The one key difference with a proper product backlog is that projects are listed chronologically, instead of being ordered by priority.

Product features listed in this backlog are scoped to require the work of a small- to medium-sized technical team over the course of one to three months, and thus require a commitment over that period. If you are an individual interested in more bite-sized contributions to these projects, we encourage you to visit their open issues in their code respositories or visit the [Open Source Center Hub](https://hub.osc.dial.community/c/osc/37) where you will find a myriad of opportunities.

## How to contribute

Once you have identified a project that you and your team would like to tackle, get in touch directly with that project. If you need a connection, drop us a line at [dev@digitalpublicgoods.net](mailto:dev@digitalpublicgoods.net) and we will be happy to assist.

## How to add projects to the backlog

A project is required to be a digital public good to be listed in this backlog. Refer to the [Digital Public Goods Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/) for the requirements of becoming a digital public good. Nominations of new digital public goods are accepted through the [submission form](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/submission).

To add new projects to the backlog, refer to the open source [code repository](https://github.com/unicef/publicgoods-backlog) behind this website.
